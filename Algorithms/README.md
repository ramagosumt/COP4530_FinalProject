# COP4530 FINAL PROJECT

## COMMAND LINE INTERFACE FOR PATH FINDING ALGORITHMS IN ROBOT NAVIGATION

Graph Search algorithms, **_Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Astar and Djikstra's_**, that allow robots to travel to their goal states

To create an executable, please run this command in terminal
```bash
make all
```
To run the actual program, please run this command
```bash
./main <Testfile Name> <Algorithm Name>
```
where "Algorithm Name" refers to one of these keywords: **_DFS , BFS , AS or Dijkstra_**
      "Testfile Name" refers to the **_text file_** that contains number of rows & columns as well as coordinates of source node, goal nodes, amd walls
