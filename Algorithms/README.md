## Assignment 1 Robot Navigation Problem

Implementation of tree based search algorithm so that robot can find a path to any of the goals, agorithms used are **_Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Astar and Djikstra's_**, to create an executable do,
```bash
make all
```
To run the program do,
```bash
./main <testfilename> <Algorithm Name>
```
where Algorithm name can take values DFS , BFS ,AS or Dijkstra. Refer to our report for more details.
